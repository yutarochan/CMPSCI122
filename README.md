## Academic Integrity Policy
In accordance to Penn State's academic integrity policy:
> Academic integrity includes a commitment by all members of the University community not to engage in or tolerate acts of falsification, misrepresentation or deception. Such acts of dishonesty violate the fundamental ethical principles of the University community and compromise the worth of work completed by others.‚Äù

By any means, I do not advocate for the infringement of academic integrity. However, I am of a strong advocate for providing references and additional perspectives to how a problem is solved. In this source, I attempt to fulfill that object.

If there are any issues or concerns with this repository, please notify me through filing an issue.

# CMPSCI 122 DPQ
Repository for all the Daily Practice Questions with attempted solution and instructor feedback.

Does not guarantee for the answers to be correct, but attempts to organize answers and ensures the quality of the responses are good enough. Make pull request to catch any bugs, errors or mistakes that I may have made.

## Academic Integrity Policy
In accordance to Penn State's academic integrity policy:
> Academic integrity includes a commitment by all members of the University community not to engage in or tolerate acts of falsification, misrepresentation or deception. Such acts of dishonesty violate the fundamental ethical principles of the University community and compromise the worth of work completed by others.‚Äù

By any means, I do not advocate for the infringement of academic integrity. However, I am of a strong advocate for providing references and additional perspectives to how a problem is solved. In this source, I attempt to fulfill that object.

If there are any issues or concerns with this repository, please notify me through filing an issue.

**Yesterday's lecture said that a good program should be able to discuss loop invariants. To do so, one has to know what those are.
NOTE: They are NOT the loop conditions!**

**Define loop invariant in your own words, as you would describe it to a classmate.**

**Your description should suggest why { 1+1 == 2 } and { x < x+1 } would not be suitable as loop invariants.**

## Attempt 1
To best explain the concept of loop invariants, the following story/visual analogy can be used to visualize and conceptualize the fundamental concepts pertaining to loop invariants (I apologize for the long, and perhaps incomprehensible answer):

CMPSCI 122 lecture has just ended and you and your friend just got out of the lecture hall. As you start heading towards the exit, your friend asks, "Gee, I didn't really understand what the Prof. mean by loop invariants. We really never covered that in 121 as well so I'm really confused." You, who didn't have the chance to eat breakfast because you were running late to class replied, "Well I'm a bit hungry and feel like getting something to eat now. Come with me and I'll also explain to you what loop invariants are."

So you and your friend walk up to the snack vending machine and you dig out of your pocket 5 one dollar coins and show them to your friend, "Here I have 5 dollar coins in my pocket, or basically 5 individual objects (if you consider coins as a subset of an object) can you tell me whether it's true?" Your friend looking at you bewilderingly responds, "Uhh yeah, you do."

"Great, this in the context of the number of 'coins' that I have would be my 'initial conditions'. In other words represents a state of some kind before I repeat a process through a loop. In this case, since I'm really hungry I'm going to buy myself some bag of chips."

Before you dropped your dollar coin, you again ask "I just want to make sure before I drop this coin that I have five objects in total, right?" Your friend nods as you drop the coin in the slot and punched the keypad for what popped out a bag of Cheetos from the machine. You take out the bag of chips, and in both your hands now have 4 coins and 1 bag of chip and again ask your friend, "Now if we were to also consider the bag of chip as an object as well, how many objects do we have in total?" Your friend answers "5".

"Right, although the individual count for the two type of objects, the snacks and the coin is different, however the fact that we have 5 objects still remains true. Now its also true that I'm still hungry, so I'll continue to repeat the process of buying three more bags of chips." You explain as you plop in the dollar coins three more times, and out with 3 bags of chips.

"In other words, even though the count of the chip and the coin changes with each iteration of purchases I make, what remains constant is the amount of objects I have present before and after the purchase process. This is also known as a 'loop invariant'. The key take away here is to understand that even though all the values of the intermediate variables change, if asserted in a certain manner must be consistent before and after each iteration body process," you explain as you start munching on the bag of Cheetos, "This is even true even if I didn't even make a purchase at all."

"Ahh now I get it! Since you didn't make the purchase (or made 0 iterations), you still have 5 objects present with you, so the invariant still holds true!" Your friend snaps with a grin.

"Now there are cases in which the invariant can become false..." You put in your last coin and punch the number, this time for a pop tart. As the coils of the old machine begin turning, you suddenly kick the machine and suddenly the coil jams. "You see, although I made a purchase, I am supposed to have a total of 5 objects (5 snacks) at this point. But because of some external operation/factor we find that the assertion of me having 5 snacks in total become false since I only have 4 objects at hand now..."

>That is a rather good analogy. I would just tweak your use of "external" in "external operation/factor" -- since I assume that everything that happens to a loop is internal. You would say that losing your invariant means the code is broken; just as you would say that losing your 5th item means the machine is broken. And with that out of the way, could you address why the two examples would not be good invariants? (You have most of the relevant info here) (1.5/1.0)

## Attempt 2
Although the statement {1 + 1 == 2} is considered true, the assertion however is not considered as being a proper loop invariant because the statement is not associated with the intermediate variables that contribute to the state of the loop invariants.

On the otherhand, {x < x + 1}, provides an intermediate variable which (assumes) changes dynamically over the course of time the loop is being executed and is also true for all values, the invariant assertion must be juxtaposed between two or more intermediate variables which associate with each other within the loop operations.
>okay; it is certainly necessary to refer to some local variables to be useful, but it might not always be necessary to involve two or more -- I could imagine (x > 0) or (p is prime and p < 100) to be suitable (1.0/1.0)

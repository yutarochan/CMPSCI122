# DPQ 1-20-2016

**Monday's lecture had two different definitions for `class TimeOfDay. The second has an implementation for a method named advanceTime. Implement a similar method (also void advanceTime( int deltaSeconds)) for the first version of that class.**

## Attempt #1

	   void advanceTime( int deltaSeconds) {
	   	hour += deltaSeconds / (60 * 60); deltaSeconds %= (60 * 60);
		minute += deltaSeconds / 60; deltaSeconds %= 60;
		second += deltaSeconds;
	   }

> The syntax is correct, but the logic is flawed. It claims that 1 second after 1:00:59 is 1:00:60. (1.0/1.0)

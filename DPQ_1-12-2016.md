**Describe an efficient algorithm to solve the following problem. C++ code is not required in your answer (but you should be able to do that too). Given a large array filled with small positive integers (all values under 100), determine the value that appears least frequently. The value reported must actually be present in the data (zero occurrences do not count).**

Given an integer array, containing values from 1 to 100 inclusive, we can find the values of least frequency by the following method:

We first define a two dimensional integer array, for this we can call count, (essentially a 100 row by 2 col data structure) which will be used as the data structure necessary to hold a) the number and b) the frequency of the given number. A two dimensional array would be necessary as we will be using this to keep track of the values associated with the frequencies later in the process. Next we would perform a for-loop over each of the elements in the given array of numbers. For each of the given numbers in the array, we can use the value from the element (minus 1) as the index value for the count array for which we will increment by one on the first element of the second dimension to indicate a single occurrence of the value. As a result of performing this operation, we are now able to accumulate the frequencies for each value from 1 to 100.

Next, to report the values of the smallest non-zero frequency of the numbers that occur from 1 to 100, we would now sort the frequencies of the count array (perhaps with a decently fast sorting algorithm, which averages in the performance of O(n log n), i.e. quick sort) and ensure that we also swap the first dimensional values as well to make sure we maintain the association between the count frequency and the particular value. Given that the count array is properly sorted, we can now iterate through the count array by first initializing an integer variable which will keep track of the smallest frequency count present (we will initially set this value to 0). As we iterate through the entire array, we will only print out the appropriate values under the given conditions:
      a) First, as stated in the problem, we must not print any values with zero frequencies
      b) if the frequency of the value is greater than zero, the following cases can occur:
         i) The min variable is zero: we can print out the associated value of the frequency and assign the frequency of the value to the min.
         ii) The frequency is the same as the min variable: we can print out the value.
         iii) The frequency is greater than the min variable: we can just do nothing, or simply break out of the loop because we are sure that any of the above frequencies are greater than the previous one as we have sorted the count variables.

Therefore, as a result of performing the above operations we are able to sufficiently find the values of least frequency within a reasonable amount of time (approximately between O(n) or O(n log n) depending on whether the input data sources are greater than the frequency count array for which we perform the sort operations.

> A very good solution; it turns out that you can do well even without that sort step. You can identify a smallest nonzero count value in single pass through your data; and then you can identify all the values with that frequency in a second pass. (2.0/1.0)

**The int type in many computers only holds integers up to about 10 digits. Some algorithms in cryptography use integers with hundreds of digits.

These big integers could be represented as arrays of digits. If that is the case, estimate the time (using Big-O notation) to:

* add two n-digit numbers (consider how you do that yourself)
* multiply two n-digit numbers (consider how you do that yourself)
* exponentiate some small value (like 3) to a power that is an n-digit number;

  for example: (3*3)*3)*3..... in a loop

  NOTE: the single digit 3 is NOT an n-digit number!**

## Attempt #1

- For adding two n-digit numbers, it would potentially take O(n) operations since adding only requires you to add up the corresponding indexes (with carry over considered).

- To multiply two n-digit numbers (using the traditional method of multiplication), it would cost O(n^2) operations since you need to multiply for each place value of the second number being multiplied.

- For exponentiation, it would be a repeated process of doing multiple operations of multiplications and thus would cost O(c^n), where c is a constant.

> The first two answers look good; the third is incomplete. All you say is that there are multiple operations, which says nothing about the growth rate. (1.0/1.0)

**Suppose class TimeOfDay declared a method void showTime that would display the time as 12:34 AM or 3:45 PM.**

**Implement this method in such a way that it would work equally well for both versions of this class, assuming they both support all the accessor methods shown in the lecture slides.**

**NOTE: The two example strings above must both be possible (and correct) outputs.**

Assuming that the initial hours are based on a 24-hour clock base:

	 void showTime() {
	         cout << (getHour() % 12) << ":" << ((getMin()<10)?"0":"") << getMin() << ":"
		      << ((getSecond()<10)?"0":"") << getSecond() << " "
		      << (((getHour() / 12) == 0) ? "AM" : "PM") << endl;
	 }

> The syntax is okay, but the logic is flawed. "12:34 AM" is not possible output. Also the problem as described would not include the seconds. (1.0/1.0)
